- App starts with user input in text form, and a base url
  - fetch that url
  - look for "action buttons" on that page with screenreader stuff to guide
  - for each:
    - fake a "click" on those buttons, and watch for dom changes.
    - in the changed dom, look for input places and buttons that are relevant.
  - return all the potential action's data to the frontend
